**Built by a degen, for degens.**

TiltCheck is a modular, AI-assisted ecosystem designed to fix the worst parts of online casino culture — scams, unfair bonuses, predatory patterns, tilt-driven decisions, and chaotic Discord communities.

It doesn't try to stop degens from being degens.  
It just gives them a smarter, safer, and more transparent way to play.

---

## What Is TiltCheck?

TiltCheck is a suite of independent but interoperable tools that help casino communities:

- **reduce scams** (SusLink)
- **track bonuses** (CollectClock)
- **validate promos** (FreeSpinScan)
- **tip safely** (JustTheTip)
- **detect tilt** (TiltCheck Core)
- **score casinos** (Casino Trust Engine)
- **score users** (Degen Trust Engine)
- **route surveys** (QualifyFirst)
- **play games** (DA&D)
- **stay accountable** (Accountabilibuddy)

Every module is Discord-first, non-custodial, and optimized for low-cost serverless infrastructure.

---

## Core Principles

1. **Modularity** — Every tool stands alone
2. **Interoperability** — Tools share insights through trust engines
3. **Predictive Intelligence** — AI evaluates fairness, bonus cycles, and tilt
4. **Cost Discipline** — Built on free-tier infra (Cloudflare, Supabase, etc.)
5. **Degen Ergonomics** — Simple, funny, blunt, and extremely practical

## Branch Protection & Required Checks

TiltCheck protects `main` with required status checks:
- `components-a11y` (shared components: bundle, contrast, a11y)
- `landing-a11y` (landing pages: a11y)
- `Analyze Code` (CodeQL security scanning)

See [`docs/tiltcheck/17-branch-protection.md`](docs/tiltcheck/17-branch-protection.md) for details on the ruleset.

## Automation & Security

TiltCheck includes comprehensive automation for security, reliability, and maintenance:

- **🔐 Security Scanning:** CodeQL (daily), Dependabot (weekly), pnpm audit (daily)
- **🤖 Dependency Updates:** Automated PRs with safe auto-merge for patch/minor updates
- **📋 Issue/PR Templates:** Standardized reporting with security checklists
- **🏷️ Auto-labeling:** Automatic PR labels based on changed files and size
- **🧹 Stale Bot:** Automatic cleanup of inactive issues/PRs
- **👥 CODEOWNERS:** Automatic review requests for security-sensitive changes
- **💚 Health Monitoring:** Production service health checks every 6 hours

**Quick Start:**
- Most automations are already active and require no setup
- See [AUTOMATION-SETUP.md](./AUTOMATION-SETUP.md) for configuration guide
- See [AUTOMATION-REFERENCE.md](./AUTOMATION-REFERENCE.md) for quick reference

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Configure Discord bot and dashboard
cp apps/discord-bot/.env.example apps/discord-bot/.env
cp services/dashboard/.env.example services/dashboard/.env
# Edit .env files with your Discord credentials

# Start dashboard (terminal 1)
pnpm --filter @tiltcheck/dashboard dev

# Start Discord bot (terminal 2)
pnpm --filter discord-bot dev

# Test in Discord
# /ping
# /trust casino stake.com
# /trust user @username
# /scan https://example.com
```

See **[QUICKSTART.md](./QUICKSTART.md)** for 5-minute setup, **[ONE-LAUNCH-DEPLOYMENT.md](./ONE-LAUNCH-DEPLOYMENT.md)** for one-command Docker deployment, **[DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md)** for full production guide, or **[SPACESHIP-DEPLOYMENT-ENV.md](./SPACESHIP-DEPLOYMENT-ENV.md)** for complete Spaceship/Hyperlift environment variables.

### Production Deployment

# 2. Login and link project
railway login
railway link

# 3. Set environment variables (see guides below)
railway variables set DISCORD_TOKEN="your_token"

- **[Trust Rollup Production](./docs/TRUST-ROLLUP-PRODUCTION.md)** - Real casino data integration
- **[Production Deployment Checklist](./docs/PRODUCTION-DEPLOYMENT-CHECKLIST.md)** - Step-by-step deployment verification

### Components + A11y Audits

Run the brand-aligned component library and automated accessibility checks:

```bash
# Bundle + contrast + DOM contrast + Pa11y + Lighthouse
pnpm audit:all

# Serve bundled components locally
pnpm a11y:serve  # open http://localhost:5178/index.html

# Minimal DOM snapshot tests
pnpm test:components
```

Artifacts are written to `dist/components/` (including Lighthouse reports). See `docs/tiltcheck/17-components-audits.md` for details.

### For Contributors

1. **Read the docs** in `/docs/tiltcheck/`
2. **Review SETUP.md** for monorepo workflow
3. **Use the Copilot Agent** — it knows the entire architecture
4. **Follow the guidelines** in `CONTRIBUTING.md`
5. **Keep modules independent** — use the Event Router
6. **Stay non-custodial** — never hold user funds

### For Developers

Documentation is the single source of truth.  
Start with:
- `SETUP.md` for monorepo setup
- `docs/tiltcheck/0-intro.md` for ecosystem overview
- `docs/tiltcheck/9-architecture.md` for system design
- `services/event-router/README.md` for event system
- `docs/tiltcheck/13-discord-bots.md` for Discord integration

### Questions?

The custom Copilot Agent can answer questions like:
- "How does the Event Router work?"
- "How does JustTheTip avoid custody?"
- "Where should I add a new Discord command?"
- "What's the flat-fee rule?"
- "How do trust engines communicate?"
- "How do I create a new module?"

- **modular** (independent tools)
- **Discord-first** (UI comes later)
- **degen-friendly** (practical, not preachy)

It's built by someone who understands the problems firsthand.
