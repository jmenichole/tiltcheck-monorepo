**Built by a degen, for degens.**

TiltCheck is a modular, AI-assisted ecosystem designed to fix the worst parts of online casino culture — scams, unfair bonuses, predatory patterns, tilt-driven decisions, and chaotic Discord communities.

It doesn't try to stop degens from being degens.  
It just gives them a smarter, safer, and more transparent way to play.

## What Is TiltCheck?

TiltCheck is a suite of independent but interoperable tools that help casino communities:

- **reduce scams** (SusLink)
- **track bonuses** (CollectClock)
- **validate promos** (FreeSpinScan)
- **tip safely** (JustTheTip)
- **detect tilt** (TiltCheck Core)
- **score casinos** (Casino Trust Engine)
- **score users** (Degen Trust Engine)
- **route surveys** (QualifyFirst)
- **play games** (DA&D)
- **stay accountable** (Accountabilibuddy)

Every module is Discord-first, non-custodial, and optimized for low-cost serverless infrastructure.

---

## Core Principles

1. **Modularity** — Every tool stands alone
2. **Interoperability** — Tools share insights through trust engines
3. **Predictive Intelligence** — AI evaluates fairness, bonus cycles, and tilt
4. **Cost Discipline** — Built on free-tier infra (Cloudflare, Supabase, etc.)
5. **Degen Ergonomics** — Simple, funny, blunt, and extremely practical

## Getting Started

### Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Configure Discord bot and dashboard
cp apps/discord-bot/.env.example apps/discord-bot/.env
cp services/dashboard/.env.example services/dashboard/.env
# Edit .env files with your Discord credentials

# Start dashboard (terminal 1)
pnpm --filter @tiltcheck/dashboard dev

# Start Discord bot (terminal 2)
pnpm --filter discord-bot dev

# Test in Discord
# /ping
# /trust casino stake.com
# /trust user @username
# /scan https://example.com
```

See **[QUICKSTART.md](./QUICKSTART.md)** for 5-minute setup or **[DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md)** for production deployment.

### Components + A11y Audits

Run the brand-aligned component library and automated accessibility checks:

```bash
# Bundle + contrast + DOM contrast + Pa11y + Lighthouse
pnpm audit:all

# Serve bundled components locally
pnpm a11y:serve  # open http://localhost:5178/index.html

# Minimal DOM snapshot tests
pnpm test:components
```

Artifacts are written to `dist/components/` (including Lighthouse reports). See `docs/tiltcheck/17-components-audits.md` for details.

### For Contributors

1. **Read the docs** in `/docs/tiltcheck/`
2. **Review SETUP.md** for monorepo workflow
3. **Use the Copilot Agent** — it knows the entire architecture
4. **Follow the guidelines** in `CONTRIBUTING.md`
5. **Keep modules independent** — use the Event Router
6. **Stay non-custodial** — never hold user funds

### For Developers

Documentation is the single source of truth.  
Start with:
- `SETUP.md` for monorepo setup
- `docs/tiltcheck/0-intro.md` for ecosystem overview
- `docs/tiltcheck/9-architecture.md` for system design
- `services/event-router/README.md` for event system
- `docs/tiltcheck/13-discord-bots.md` for Discord integration

### Questions?

The custom Copilot Agent can answer questions like:
- "How does the Event Router work?"
- "How does JustTheTip avoid custody?"
- "Where should I add a new Discord command?"
- "What's the flat-fee rule?"
- "How do trust engines communicate?"
- "How do I create a new module?"

## Development Philosophy

TiltCheck is intentionally:
- **scrappy** (no over-engineering)
- **cheap** (free-tier optimized)
- **modular** (independent tools)
- **Discord-first** (UI comes later)
- **degen-friendly** (practical, not preachy)

It's built by someone who understands the problems firsthand.
