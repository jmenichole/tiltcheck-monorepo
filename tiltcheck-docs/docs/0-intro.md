# 0. Introduction to the TiltCheck Ecosystem

TiltCheck is a modular, AI-assisted ecosystem built **by a degen, for degens** — designed to fix the worst parts of online casino culture, daily bonuses, Discord bots, swapping, tipping, fairness checking, user trust, and community tools.

TiltCheck does **not** try to stop degens from being degens.  
It simply gives them a smarter, safer, and more transparent way to play.

The ecosystem is intentionally lean, serverless-friendly, non-custodial, and optimized for solo-founder development. Each module works independently but plugs into the shared trust engines, Discord bot interface, and AI reasoning layer.

Together, the modules build a unified system that can:

- reduce scams  
- identify unfair casino patterns  
- catch promo mismatches  
- monitor player tilt  
- detect harmful behavior  
- recommend cooldowns and smart actions  
- route surveys  
- run games  
- collect bonuses  
- score casinos  
- score users  
- process non-custodial tips  
- and help the founder find grants, credits, and hackathon opportunities  

TiltCheck is the first real attempt at a transparent **“Degen Operating System”** — a toolkit that makes gambling communities safer, funnier, smarter, and way less predatory.

It is built around five principles:

1. **Modularity** – Every tool stands alone.  
2. **Interoperability** – Tools share insights through trust engines.  
3. **Predictive Intelligence** – AI evaluates fairness, bonus cycles, and tilt.  
4. **Cost Discipline** – Prefer free-tier and serverless infrastructure.  
5. **Degen Ergonomics** – Simple, funny, blunt, and extremely practical.

This documentation describes the entire architecture, every module, how they interact, and how the AI agent should reason about the system.
