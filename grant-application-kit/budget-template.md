## Budget Justification

### Why This Budget?

**Development (60%):**
The majority of funds support core development because TiltCheck is a technical product requiring:
- Custom AI/ML integration for scam and tilt detection
- Blockchain integration for non-custodial transactions
- Complex Discord bot architecture
- Multiple interconnected modules

**Infrastructure (20%):**
Serverless-first architecture keeps costs low, but we need:
- Reliable hosting for 24/7 bot availability
- AI API access for pattern detection
- Blockchain node access for transactions
- Monitoring and analytics tools

**Community (15%):**
Success depends on real-world testing and adoption:
- Beta partners need support and incentives
- User feedback drives iteration
- Community building ensures adoption
- Documentation enables self-service

**Security (5%):**
Safety tools must be secure:
- External code review catches vulnerabilities
- Penetration testing validates security
- Smart contract audits prevent exploits
- Compliance reduces legal risk

---

## Cost Efficiency Measures

**How We Keep Costs Low:**

1. **Solo Founder:** No team salaries, just development costs
2. **Free-Tier First:** Cloudflare and Supabase free tiers used where possible
3. **Serverless:** Pay only for actual usage, not idle capacity
4. **Open Source:** Leverage existing libraries and tools
5. **AI Efficiency:** Optimize prompts to minimize API costs
6. **Modular Design:** Build incrementally, not all at once

**Grant funds enable faster development while maintaining cost discipline.**
