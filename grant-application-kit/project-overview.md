**One-page summary for grant applications**

## Project Name
**TiltCheck Ecosystem**

## Tagline
*Making online casino communities safer, smarter, and more transparent — by a degen, for degens*

---

## The Problem

Online casino and gambling communities on Discord face critical safety challenges:
- **Scam links** spread rapidly in casino Discord servers
- **Unfair bonuses** and promotional manipulation
- **Tilt-driven behavior** leads to harmful gambling patterns
- **No trust systems** to verify casino reliability or user reputation
- **Predatory practices** target vulnerable community members

Current solutions are either nonexistent or corporate tools that don't understand the culture.
