# Elevator Pitches

**Quick pitches for different contexts**

---

## 30-Second Pitch

**Use for:** Quick intros, networking, tweet threads

### Version 1 (Problem-focused):
"Casino Discord servers have a massive scam and safety problem. TiltCheck is a Discord-first toolkit that detects scam links, tracks tilt behavior, and creates transparent trust scores for both casinos and users. Built by someone who actually understands the culture."

### Version 2 (Solution-focused):
"TiltCheck is safety infrastructure for online casino communities. We provide AI-powered scam detection, tilt monitoring, and non-custodial tipping - all through Discord bots. Think of it as the 'safety layer' for the $250B+ online gambling market."

### Version 3 (Identity-focused):
"I'm building TiltCheck - a suite of Discord bots that make casino communities safer without killing the vibe. As a female founder in crypto gambling, I'm bringing transparency and harm reduction to a space that desperately needs it."

---

## 1-Minute Pitch

**Use for:** Grant applications, elevator encounters, demo day intros

### Full 1-Minute Version:

"Casino Discord communities have hundreds of thousands of members but zero safety infrastructure. Scam links spread unchecked, bonuses get manipulated, and users spiral into tilt with no intervention.

TiltCheck solves this with a modular Discord-first ecosystem. Our tools include:
- SusLink for real-time scam detection
- TiltCheck Core for AI-powered wellness interventions  
- Non-custodial tipping on Solana
- Transparent trust engines for casinos and users

Unlike corporate gambling tools, TiltCheck is built by someone who understands the culture. We're not trying to stop people from gambling - we're making it safer, smarter, and more transparent.

I'm a solo female founder using serverless architecture to keep costs near zero while serving thousands of users. Our roadmap includes network effects across Discord servers and sustainable revenue through survey routing and premium features.

We're looking for [grant amount/investment] to launch the MVP and prove the model works."

## 2-Minute Pitch

**Use for:** Investor meetings, detailed grant apps, podcast intros

### Full 2-Minute Version:

**The Problem (30 seconds):**
Online casino Discord servers represent a $250B+ market with zero safety infrastructure. In these communities:
- Scam links spread rapidly, costing users millions
- Casinos manipulate bonuses with no accountability
- Users exhibit clear tilt behavior with no intervention
- There's no trust system to verify casinos or users
- Traditional gambling safety tools don't fit the culture

Most solutions are corporate, patronizing, or nonexistent.

**The Solution (45 seconds):**
TiltCheck is a modular ecosystem of Discord bots designed for casino communities.

Our core tools:
1. **SusLink** - Real-time link scanning and risk scoring
2. **TiltCheck Core** - AI-powered tilt detection with cooldown recommendations
3. **JustTheTip** - Non-custodial tipping and swapping via Solana
4. **Trust Engines** - Transparent scoring for casinos and users
5. **CollectClock** - Bonus tracking with pattern detection

Everything is Discord-first, non-custodial, and built on free-tier infrastructure. We use AI for pattern detection and predictions while respecting user autonomy.

**The Traction/Ask (30 seconds):**
I'm [Name], a solo female founder in the crypto gambling space. I've built complete technical documentation, identified key partnerships, and designed for free-tier survival using Cloudflare and Supabase.

We're seeking [amount] to launch the MVP covering SusLink, TiltCheck Core, and JustTheTip. First-year goals: 50+ Discord servers, 10K+ users, measurable scam reduction.

Long-term, we'll build revenue through survey routing, premium features, and network subscriptions - all while staying ethical and community-aligned.

**Why It Works (15 seconds):**
TiltCheck succeeds because it's built by someone who gets the culture. Not an outsider trying to "fix" gambling, but someone making it genuinely safer while respecting what makes these communities work.
