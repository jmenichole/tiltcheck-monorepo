# AI Gateway Service

AI-powered intelligence for TiltCheck ecosystem with 7 core applications.

## Quick Start

### 1. Configure Environment
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your OpenAI API key
```

### 2. Environment Variables
| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | **Yes** | - | Your OpenAI API key |
| `OPENAI_MODEL` | No | `gpt-4o-mini` | Model to use (gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini, gpt-3.5-turbo) |
| `AI_GATEWAY_PORT` | No | `3002` | HTTP server port |

### 3. Run the Service
```bash
# Development
pnpm dev

# Production
pnpm start
```

### 4. Fallback Mode
If `OPENAI_API_KEY` is not set, the service runs in **mock mode** with predefined responses. This is useful for development and testing without API costs.

## Applications

**Usage**:
```javascript
const response = await aiGateway.tiltDetection({
  application: 'tilt-detection',
  prompt: 'Analyze behavior',
  context: {
    recentBets: [10, 20, 40, 80],
    sessionDuration: 120,
    losses: 150
  }
});
```

### 5. Natural Language Commands
Parses natural language into bot commands.

**Features**:

  context: {}
});
```

### 6. Personalized Recommendations
Suggests surveys, games, promos based on user profile.

**Features**:

const response = await aiGateway.recommendations({
  application: 'recommendations',
  prompt: 'Get recommendations',
  context: {
    userId: 'user123',
    profile: { hasPets: true, interests: ['gaming'] }
  }
});
```

### 7. User Support
AI-powered help and support responses.

**Features**:

const response = await aiGateway.support({
  application: 'support',
  prompt: 'How do I withdraw my earnings?',
  context: {}
});
```

## Caching

The AI Gateway includes intelligent caching to reduce costs and improve response times:

- 1-hour cache timeout
- Automatic cache key generation
- Cache statistics tracking
- Expired entry cleanup

## Event Integration

The service listens for `ai.request` events and publishes `ai.response` events, enabling seamless integration with other TiltCheck modules.

## Cost Optimization

- Smart caching reduces repeated API calls
- Model selection (gpt-4o-mini for most tasks)
- Batch processing support
- Rate limiting built-in
- Token usage tracking

## Production Deployment

The AI Gateway is **production-ready** with OpenAI integration:

1. Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable
2. Optionally set `OPENAI_MODEL` (default: `gpt-4o-mini` for cost efficiency)
3. Deploy to Railway, Render, or any Node.js host

### Response Format
All responses include a `source` field indicating whether the response came from:
- `openai` - Real OpenAI API response
- `mock` - Fallback mock response (when API unavailable)

```javascript
{
  success: true,
  data: { ... },
  usage: { promptTokens: 150, completionTokens: 100, totalTokens: 250 },
  source: 'openai'  // or 'mock'
}
```

### Cost Estimates (gpt-4o-mini)
| Application | ~Tokens/Request | ~Cost/1000 Requests |
|-------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Survey Matching | 250 | $0.04 |
| Card Generation | 500 | $0.08 |
| Moderation | 180 | $0.03 |
| Tilt Detection | 400 | $0.06 |
| NL Commands | 90 | $0.01 |
| Recommendations | 500 | $0.08 |
| Support | 220 | $0.04 |

railway variables set OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
```

### 4. Verify Deployment
```bash
# Check status and logs in Railway dashboard
# Or via CLI:

```

### 5. Test API Endpoints
```bash
# Get your Railway service URL from dashboard, then:
curl https://your-service.railway.app/health

# Test moderation
curl -X POST https://your-service.railway.app/api/moderation \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt": "Check this link!", "context": {"url": "https://example.com"}}'

# Test support
curl -X POST https://your-service.railway.app/api/support \
