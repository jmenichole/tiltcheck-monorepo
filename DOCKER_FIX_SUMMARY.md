# Docker Hub Login Fix - Implementation Summary

## Issue

The GitHub Actions workflows (`deploy-dashboard.yml` and `deploy-bot.yml`) were failing at the "Log in to Docker Hub" step with the error:

```
##[error]Username and password required
```

## Root Cause

The Docker Hub authentication secrets (`DOCKER_USERNAME` and `DOCKER_PASSWORD`) are either:
- Not configured in the GitHub repository settings
- Set but contain empty values
- Not accessible to the workflow due to permissions

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Credential Validation

Both deployment workflows now validate Docker Hub credentials BEFORE attempting to log in. This provides clear, actionable error messages instead of cryptic failures.

**Implementation:**
- Created reusable validation script: `scripts/validate-docker-credentials.sh`
- Added validation step to both workflows that runs before Docker login
- Validation fails fast with helpful error messages pointing to setup documentation

### 2. Created Comprehensive Documentation

**New Files:**
- `.github/DOCKER_HUB_SETUP.md` - Complete setup guide with:
  - Step-by-step instructions for creating Docker Hub access tokens
  - How to add secrets to GitHub repository
  - Troubleshooting common issues
  - Security best practices
  
**Updated Files:**
- `DOCKER.md` - Enhanced CI/CD section with detailed setup instructions
  - Emphasis on using access tokens instead of passwords
  - Clear explanation of required secrets

### 3. Security Improvements

- Documentation emphasizes using Docker Hub **access tokens** instead of account passwords
- Clear instructions for creating scoped tokens with minimal permissions
- Security best practices section covering token rotation and management

### 4. Docker PATH Configuration

- Added automatic PATH configuration for Docker CLI in both workflows
- Handles cases where Docker is installed in `$HOME/.docker/bin` (custom runners or local environments)
- Standard GitHub Actions runners are unaffected (Docker already in PATH)
- See `.github/DOCKER_HUB_SETUP.md` for manual PATH configuration instructions

## What You Need To Do

**The workflows are now ready, but you must configure the Docker Hub secrets in your GitHub repository:**

### Step 1: Create Docker Hub Access Token

1. Go to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com) and log in
2. Navigate to Account Settings → Security → Access Tokens
3. Click "New Access Token"
4. Name it "GitHub Actions" with Read & Write permissions
5. Copy the token (you won't see it again!)

### Step 2: Add Secrets to GitHub

1. Go to: https://github.com/jmenichole/tiltcheck-monorepo/settings/secrets/actions
2. Click "New repository secret"
3. Add two secrets:
   - **DOCKER_USERNAME**: Your Docker Hub username
   - **DOCKER_PASSWORD**: The access token from Step 1

### Step 3: Test

1. Push a commit to trigger the workflow
2. Check the Actions tab
3. Verify the "Validate Docker Hub credentials" step passes
4. Confirm "Log in to Docker Hub" succeeds

## Files Changed

```
.github/workflows/deploy-dashboard.yml  # Added validation step
.github/workflows/deploy-bot.yml        # Added validation step
scripts/validate-docker-credentials.sh  # New validation script
.github/DOCKER_HUB_SETUP.md            # New comprehensive setup guide
DOCKER.md                               # Enhanced CI/CD documentation
```

## Benefits

1. **Clearer Errors**: Failed builds now show exactly what's wrong and how to fix it
2. **Faster Debugging**: No need to dig through logs to understand auth failures
3. **Better Security**: Documentation guides users to access tokens instead of passwords
4. **Reduced Duplication**: Validation logic is in one reusable script
5. **Self-Service**: Complete documentation allows users to fix the issue themselves

## Testing Performed

- ✅ YAML syntax validation passed
- ✅ Validation script tested with and without credentials
- ✅ CodeQL security scan: 0 alerts found
- ✅ Code review: All feedback addressed
- ✅ Documentation accuracy verified

## Next Steps

1. **Configure secrets** in GitHub repository settings (see above)
2. **Trigger a workflow run** to verify the fix works
3. **Monitor the build** to ensure Docker push succeeds

## Support

If you encounter issues after configuring the secrets, refer to:
- `.github/DOCKER_HUB_SETUP.md` - Full troubleshooting guide
- `DOCKER.md` - General Docker deployment documentation

**Note**: This PR fixes the workflow configuration and validation, but does NOT configure the secrets themselves. That must be done manually in the GitHub repository settings by a repository administrator.
