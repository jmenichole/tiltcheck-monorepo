## 🚨 CRITICAL: Test Stabilization

The repository has **15 failing tests** that need immediate attention before proceeding with new features or deployment.

### Failing Test Breakdown

#### JustTheTip Module (10 failures) 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY
**Impact:** Core tipping functionality unreliable

```
Failures:
✗ Tipping Flow: min/max amount validation (4 tests)
✗ Wallet Management: duplicate registration prevention (2 tests)
✗ Wallet Management: disconnect validation (2 tests)
✗ Degen Trust: event emission (1 test)
✗ Wallet Service: transaction history ordering (1 test)
```

**Root Causes:**
1. Validation logic for min/max amounts not working correctly
2. Wallet duplicate check error messages don't match test expectations
3. Wallet disconnect doesn't return expected wallet information
4. Transaction history ordering is reversed
5. Degen trust events not emitted alongside casino trust events

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Review and fix validation in `modules/justthetip/src/core.ts`
- [ ] Update error messages to match test expectations OR update tests
- [ ] Fix disconnect method to return wallet info before deletion
- [ ] Fix transaction history sort order (most recent first)
- [ ] Ensure degen trust events emit alongside casino trust

**Estimated Effort:** 4-6 hours
